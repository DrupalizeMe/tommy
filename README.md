This module was written to help explain, and explore, the Drupal 8 event dispatcher.

More information: https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21modules%21system%21core.api.php/group/events/8

Currently this module demonstrates:

- Creating a new service and tagging it with the `event_subscriber` tag
- Subscribing to an event of a specific type
- Responding when events of that type are dispatched
